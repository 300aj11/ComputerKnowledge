<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML consists of standardized codes,or "tags", that are used to define the structure of information on a web page. HTML is used to prepare documents for the World Wide Web. A web page is single a unit of information, often called a document, that is available on the World Wide Web. HTML defines several aspects of a web page including heading levels, bold, italics, images, paragraph breaks and hypertext links to other resources .</p>

<p>HTML can be compared to word processing. The text in a word processed file can be formatted in various ways. For example, a heading can be bold and in larger font size than the rest of the document. Also, specific words can be italicized for emphasis.</p>

<p>HTML is a way to define the formats of text in a web page. However, it goes further by also being able to define placement of graphics and hypertext links.</p>

<p>HTML is a sub-language of SGML, or Standard Generalized Markup Language. SGML is a system that defines and standardizes the structure of documents.</p>

<p>Both SGML and HTML utilize descriptive markup to define the structure of an area of text. In general terms, descriptive markup does not specify a particular font or point size for an area of text. Instead, it describes an area of text as a heading or a caption, for example.</p>

<p>Therefore, in HTML, text is marked as a heading, subheading, numbered list, bold, italic, etc</p>

<p>HTML is standardized and portable. A document that has been prepared using HTML markup "tags" can be viewed using a variety of web browsers, such as Netscape and Lynx. A browser interprets the tags in an HTML file and presents the file as a formatted, readable web page.</p>

<p>In addition, HTML documents can be viewed on all types of systems, such as Macintosh, PC and UNIX machines. HTML tags are used to define areas of a document as having certain characteristics.</p>

<p>The tags used in HTML usually consist of a code in between two "wickets". These codes are called container tags because the formatting described by the tags affects only the text contained between the tags.</p>

<p>For example,<B >and </B>are the starting and ending tags used to indicate an area as bold. Therefore, the following markup will yield a sentence with the word "hello" in bold.</p>

<p>Only the word<B>Hello</B>will be bold.</p>

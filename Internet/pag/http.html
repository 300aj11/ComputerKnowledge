<p>HTTP is an acronym for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. HTTP is the set of rules, or protocol, that enables hypertext data to be transferred from one computer to another, and is based on the client/server principle. Hypertext is text that is coded using the Hypertext Markup Language. These codes and HTTP work together to link resources to each other.</p>

<p>HTTP is short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is the set of rules, or protocol, that governs the transfer of hypertext between two or more computers.</p>



<p>Hypertext is text that is specially coded using a standard system called Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).</p>

<p>The HTML codes are used to create links. These links can be textual or graphic, and when clicked on, can "link" the user to another resource such as other HTML documents, text files, graphics, animation and sound.</p>

<p>HTTP is based on the client/server principle.</p>

<p>HTTP allows "computer A" (the client) to establish a connection to "computer B" (the server) and make a request. The server accepts the connection initiated by the client and sends back a response.</p>

<p>An HTTP request identifies the resource that the client is interested in and tells the server what "action" to take on the resource.</p>

<p>When a user selects a hypertext link, the client program on their computer uses HTTP to contact the server, identify a resource, and ask the server to respond with an action. The server accepts the request, and then uses HTTP to respond to or perform the action.</p>

<p>For example, when you select any of the following underlined hypertext links, you are identifying a particular resource, and asking the server to send it back to your computer in a format that your computer can display.</p>

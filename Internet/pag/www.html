<p>The World Wide Web is a system of Internet servers that supports hypertext to access several Internet protocols on a single interface. The World Wide Web is often abbreviated as the Web or WWW.The World Wide Web was developed in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee of the European Particle Physics Lab (CERN) in Switzerland.</p>

<p>The initial purpose of the Web was to use networked hypertext to facilitate communication among its members, who were located in several countries.</p>

<p>Word was soon spread beyond CERN, and a rapid growth in the number of both developers and users ensued. In addition to hypertext, the Web began to incorporate graphics, video, and sound.</p>

<p>The use of the Web has reached global proportions and has become a defining aspect of human culture in an amazingly short period of time.</p>

<p>Almost every protocol type available on the Internet is accessible on the Web. Internet protocols are sets of rules that allow for intermachine communication on the Internet.</p>

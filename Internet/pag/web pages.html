<p>A web page is a single unit of information, often called a document, that is available via the World Wide Web (WWW). A web page can be longer than one computer screen and can use more than one piece of paper when it is printed out. A web page is created using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).</p>

<p>HTMLconsists of standardized codes, or tags, that are used to define the structure of a web page. These codes enable web pages to have many features including bold text, italic text, headings, paragraph breaks and numbered or bulleted lists.</p>

<p>Web pages can contain text, images, sound files, video files and hypertext links to other Internet resources. All of these features are indicated by using HTML codes.</p>

<p>A web page is transferred to a user's computer via the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP). HTTP is the method through which hypertext files, such as web pages, are transferred over the Internet. HTTP is a client/server based Internet protocol, or set of rules.</p>

<p>Web pages generally reside on HTTP servers. A user requests a web page from an HTTP (web) server through his or her web browser client software, either by clicking on a hypertext link or designating a particular URL (Uniform Resource Locator). The server then sends the requested information to the user's computer.</p>

<p>The browser software interprets the HTML codes and presents the information contained in the web page in a readable format on the user's computer.</p>

<br><br><p>Internet is a worldwide system of interconnected computer networks. The origins of the Internet can be traced to the creation of <b>ARPANET</b> as a network of computers under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Defense in 1969.</p>

<p>Today, the <b>Internet</b> connects millions of computers around the world in a nonhierarchical manner unprecedented in the history of communications. The <b>Internet</b> is a product of the convergence of <b>media, computers,</b> and <b>telecommunications</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>Internet</b> supplements the traditional tools you use to gather <b>information, Data, Graphics, News and correspond</b> with other people. Used skillfully, the <b>Internet</b> shrinks the world and brings information, expertise, and knowledge on nearly every subject imaginable straight to your computer.</p>

<p>By the turn of the century, information, including access to the <b>Internet</b>, will be the basis for personal, economic, and political advancement. The popular name for the <b>Internet</b> is the information superhighway.</p>

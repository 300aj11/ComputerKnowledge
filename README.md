# ComputerKnowledge
This is my very first step in the field of programming. I made this web site when I was in class 8. That time my Knowledge of programming was only limited to the basic HTML and I knew that website is just bunch of web pages. So with that limited knowledge and enthusiasm for programming I created this.

And I know that there is no point of uploading this in GitHub. But this is my first step and my history.

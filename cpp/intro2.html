<p>C++ is a general-purpose, high-level programming language with low-level facilities. It is a <b>statically typed, free-form, multi-paradigm language,</b> supporting<b> procedural programming, data abstraction, object-oriented programming, generic programming</b> and <b>RTTI</b></p>

<p><b>Bjarne Stroustrup </b>developed <b>C++</b> (originally named <b>"C with Classes"</b>) in 1983 at <b>Bell Labs</b> as an enhancement to the <b>C</b> programming language.</p>

<p>Enhancements started with the addition of <b>classes</b>, followed by, among other features, <b>virtual functions, operator overloading, multiple inheritance, templates,</b> and <b>exception handling.</b> A new version of the standard (known informally as <b>C++0x</b>) is being developed.</p>

<p><b>C++</b> became popular because it combined traditional<b> C </b>programming with <b>object-oriented programming (OOP)</b> features. <b>Smalltalk </b>and other<b> OOP </b>languages did not provide the familiar structures of conventional languages such as <b>C</b> and Pascal.</p>

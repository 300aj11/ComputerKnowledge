<p>Windows XP comes with a fresh new design and many ways to customize the interface to your liking. There is a new Start Menu that is easy to use and full of new functions; or you can use the classic Start Menu if you prefer. To save space on your task bar you can group running applications according to type. For example, if you have multiple project documents open, you can group them into a pop-up menu instead of all across the task bar. This is a great feature that saves time and task bar space.</p><br><br>

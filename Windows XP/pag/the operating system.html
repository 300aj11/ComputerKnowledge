<p>The Operating System (OS) is the most important program that runs on a computer. It performs basic tasks like recognizing input from the keyboard, sending images to the display, keeping track of files, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.</p>

<p>The OS you use is what truly defines your computing experience. Some are designed to simplify the computing experience as much as possible while others are complex, offering a wide range of features and customization.</p>

<p>Since there is no OS that can satisfy every user's needs you have to find the one that's right for you. This guide will give you an idea of the operating system choices available for personal computers today.</p>

<p>With Windows ME and 2000 just getting established in the marketplace it might seem strange that Microsoft has introduced a new operating system; but they believe XP is a product that will redefine what people think of Windows.</p>

<p>XP retains features introduced in ME while adding many new ones. For example it will enable you to control your device drivers in a more precise fashion. If you install a new driver for one of your peripherals and the device malfunctions, you can roll back that individual driver to a previous state without having to uninstall or restart.</p>

<p>The "Last Good Configuration" tool logs your system configuration every time you successfully boot your PC, and if something bad happens, you can revert back to your last good configuration. With Automatic System Recovery (ASR) you can recover your system settings if you change something by mistake. XP also has protection to keep important system files safe.</p>

<p>In addition to all of the improvements found in ME's help section, a new option called Interactive Support lets you link directly to sources for tech support. By clicking on the Remote Assistance Tool you can create a peer-to-peer connection that, with your permission, allows another Windows XP user to take over your system and solve problems.</p>

<p>XP is a very quick OS. The system boots up and applications launch faster in XP than any previous Windows release. Benchmark tests indicate that on average XP is 36% faster than Windows 98 SE and equivalent to Windows 2000 in performance. Standby and Hibernation modes have been improved to quickly resume operation so you can leave your PC on, consuming minimal power.</p>

<p>Windows XP has a wide range of entertainment features and multimedia support designed to fully integrate digital media into the PC. Features include the ability to convert music tracks into digital audio, burn music CD's, listen to radio stations from across the planet and watch DVD movies on your PC. All of these functions have been integrated into one program, Windows Media Player, with an all new interface and playback facilities.</p>

<p>If you are a PC gamer, you've most likely been using Windows 98/Me even though Windows 2000 offers higher performance. Because of its game/hardware compatibility, ease of use and product support, Windows 98/Me was the OS geared towards gamers. Windows XP offers the best of both worlds: the performance and security of Windows 2000 and the game/hardware compatibility and support of Windows 98/Me.</p>
